    [workflows] Avoid usage of access token in issue-write.yml (#94011)                                                        
                                                                                                                               
    This adds a new composite workflow that allows you to download artifacts                                                   
    from other workflows without using an access token.                                                                        
                                                                                                                               
    actions/download-artifact from GitHub requires an access token in order                                                    
    to download artifacts from a different workflow, which is why we can't                                                     
    use it here if we want to avoid using a token.
